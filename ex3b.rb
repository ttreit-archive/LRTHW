#this program will do some math so I can learn about floating point numbers

#This is the original program:

 puts "#{5 / 3}"

#The original program gives the answer of 1. We need decimals!

# float "#{5 / 3}"  - This was the first thing I tried - did not work

puts "#{5 / 3.0}" #simply adding .0 to any integer will give an answer in floating point
